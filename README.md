## I'm Conor, a data scientist working in financial services, based in Edinburgh, Scotland! 👋

👨‍🔬 As a data scientist I use data and machine learning to develop models and explore new techniques to improve the lives of our customers.

📜 Read our paper surveying the [different techniques available for machine unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00939), i.e. removing the influence of data points from a trained model. 

👨‍🎓 During my PhD I used python 🐍 and C++➡️ to analyse experiments that help us understand the nuclear reactions in stars that produce the elements we see in our Universe! 🌟🔭

📜 Read my paper on how we used [transfer reactions to understand how radioactive elements in our Galaxy are produced here.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epja/s10050-020-00052-9)

📖 Also feel free to download and read my thesis describing the [two experiments that comprised my PhD](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/38582).
