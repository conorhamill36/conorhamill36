## I'm Conor, a physics PhD student at the University of Edinburgh! 👋

Currently I'm using python 🐍 and ➡️C++ to analyse experiments that help us understand the nuclear reactions in stars that produce the elements we see in our Universe! 🌟🔭

📜 Read our paper on how we used [transfer reactions to understand how radioactive elements in our Galaxy are produced here.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epja/s10050-020-00052-9)

📈 I'm also interested in using data science and machine learning algorithms to understand and solve real world issues!

😷 [Read my article on how I used web scraping and linear regression to investigate how COVID-19 disproportionately affects different communities in London.](https://medium.com/swlh/all-in-this-together-trends-in-covid-19-fatality-across-london-boroughs-from-machine-learning-e481c99d5cf0) 

📊 Currently I'm working on a project that uses several algorithms to solve a classification problem, including logistic regression, random forests and support-vector machines. 

👨‍🔬 I'm currently looking for a role in data science, where I can use programming and machine learning to get involved in a fast-paced team that's making a difference in the world.
